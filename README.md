## Stax_JS
Made by Max 2021 July 28th <br>
Stax_JS is a JavaScript library or framework for building statistics


# Insturctions
These are the offical instructions for the Stax_JS framework / library <br>
Feel free to make your own version (make it better than this).<br>
<br>
To start a project you will first need your canvas.<br>
We have the createCanvas function for that.<br>
```
createCanvas(600, 400, "columnCanvas", "staxCanvas");
```
Let's go over the arguments, the **first 2 arguments** are the width and the height, in this example 600 and 400.<br>
The **third** argument is the type of canvas we want, there is only one canvas type at the moment of writing this and that is "columnCanvas" <br>
The **fourth** and **last** agument is the id of the canvas, this id only matters when styling the canvas outside of JavaScript.<br>
(The **2 last** agruments are optional)<br>
